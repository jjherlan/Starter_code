## Getting started

At this point I’m assuming you received an invitation to view an assignment on
github classroom and accepted it. You now have a private repository of these files.
This repository contains starter code for all assignments.  

### If you are using RStudio on your desktop

To start working on an assignment, open RStudio (on your desktop or cloudserver 
where you actually see the main Rstudio screen). 

![Screenshot showing where to start creating a repository](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3ddyHNvzmRICUa_CmWQmzbz5jr9aTdo_bs9yH9ZbfUPe2LjS46TYj1FsD7CjhKL3rknFZkui-YecWokRGY03cj8occR5HJN56P5N8KJTCUPgciKCAwD8YHJEKXXOOjH-LI8k1G8p88MGB7d_6ov4EJtQQ=w879-h664-no)

Select file, new project, Version control. On the next screen select git. If this
isn't available, you may need to install git (free) on your system.  You can 
download it at https://git-scm.com/download/.  

Next you’ll need to enter the url for your repository. Look for the Code button 
(usually green) in your githbub repository (where you may be reading this...). 

![Click the green code button to get the repository url](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3c6iXUxY_YkEQktN9szfL0Jfl3-jJnjfp2dwbMU_NtnOtoCOFzJcpRN1r0X0zCZlH2gtB9JlXz7_WLgXMBAU7a2K_vwTX5taNBBWwSgsO558aqLZEtKmH_cMpwv7ukzYi7R4ffncWbcscAy8sAzBcZ4Ww=w692-h490-no?authuser=0)

Click it, then copy the 
web url (or click the copy icon). Input that into the Rstudio Repository URL 
space. Then name the project (maybe Assignment 1,2, etc?). The Create project… 
field can be left blank to just save all projects into the main directory.
Alternatively you can click Browse and make an Assignments folder if you want.
Whatever you choose, the project will be saved in new folder in that location 
using the name you chose. Note you may need to enter your github username and 
password to create the repository. If you receive other errors, you may need handle the github token authorization 
first (more info below in the 
**Github 2-factor authentication (required as of Fall 2021)** section!)


Go to the next section (**Now we can actually work in R**) to get started

### If you are using Rstudio cloud...

You'll instead see something like this:

![In Rstudio cloud, click new project to start a repository](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3dVAm8XnMQH9ebnayG0SgBgSewlPFWyJmubIbASefCQ0NKiuZHsQO6eUbzy-Y0LZ6U7KbPkmHCi91tJ4lm7xPs4xf0A3fyMXyMKuzfJ6B2tADIq_NX9GmYRrZS5OuZ6Y1DcCxyzMmmEsV-_DyV9XrLLJA=w1320-h581-no?authuser=0)

To start working on an assignment, select **New Project**, **New Project from Github repo**, 
then enter the url 
for your repository. Look for the Code button 
(usually green) in your githbub repository (where you may be reading this...). 

![In Rstudio cloud, click new project to start a repository](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3c6iXUxY_YkEQktN9szfL0Jfl3-jJnjfp2dwbMU_NtnOtoCOFzJcpRN1r0X0zCZlH2gtB9JlXz7_WLgXMBAU7a2K_vwTX5taNBBWwSgsO558aqLZEtKmH_cMpwv7ukzYi7R4ffncWbcscAy8sAzBcZ4Ww=w692-h490-no?authuser=0)

Click it, then copy the 
web url (or click the copy icon). Input that into the field asking for the URL
of your github repository. 

Note you may need to enter your github username and password to create the repository.
If you receive other errors, you may need handle the github token authorization 
first (more info below in the 
**Github 2-factor authentication (required as of Fall 2021)** section!)

The next screen will bring you to a "normal" RStudio screen. 

Before continuing,  I recommend turning down the computer usage. Free rstudiocloud 
accounts only allow so much usage, but that depends on how much power you allocate
to a project. To do this, click on the RAM icon in the upper left corner, select 
resources, and move all sliders to the far left.

![In Rstudio cloud, move all sliders to the left to give you more actual hours](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLVGtN01ndQcB622ioe8eLk0vcbTgdlE2QXG8L_q0scnCBEXjhn4Kvik3Lqm7BoiI11p0YaTYq5NlWaXa303IVly68oNYqfJoQWoNWnAyWUyo5fRcrQ39lrvFBdWP1J-qGd84xGNFN-U1aGgfF5ac6FsAA=w329-h734-no?authuser=0)

If you end up doing something more complex, you can increase allocated power to 
speed everything up. For most class code, however, low power should be fine.)

Continue to the next
section (**Now we can actually work in R**) to get started

## Now we can actually work in R

Now you can start working on the files in the repository in
Rstudio.  To view the files, make sure 
you are in the right repository.  You should see whatever you named the project in the
upper right hand corner of Rstudio. If you don't go to File > Open Project and 
navigate to where you placed the repository.  

Once you are in the right project, open the file you want to work on.   From inside the project space, go to **File**, **Open File**
and find it, or look in the Files window to find and open the file. 

![Use the file tab to navigate to the .rmd file](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3esT_YVFqbmcul63AzkXBGrjK5J6kPBMRZW_mT_JNTG7UstxeT9hInq7dA91xV8-e6DbO77u8YepXb6sO6beUo0OlSWg2fXEBbxwgYTHWo7KkZlSAsVfzgpYiL7QbveqRLjctmUYb3RJninK9jMK4DP9A=w800-h452-no?authuser=0)

Then **Knit** the file. Note the first time you do this in a project you may be
prompted to install a number of packages!  If you are using a webservice you may
also need to allow pop-ups in your browser.

![The knit button turns your .rmd file into other products](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3dlSoGJDHtdGqEBr8L2X-yqZ-08Z95RHUMvaxHqF9EOFcBnqtamYMAWOr75mohUSL_KvWtBTt-u4KrdoHgceHc-sZiViw6l9ZqEQToLIsy6AwvQIQMrJgLbtXfV6gNLDgQvgT3N7aq9pk9-x5ugpegjYA=w378-h109-no)

Then **Knit** the file. Note the first time you do this in a project you may be
prompted to install a number of packages!  If you are using a webservice you may
also need to allow pop-ups in your browser. Don't be surprised if a new window 
pops up (it should if you have html output). 

The **Knit** button saves the .Rmd file and renders a new version whose output 
depends on what you selected in the header. You will
see instructions. As you update the .Rmd file and **Knit** it, it will update. Make
sure you also save changes and **Commit** and **Push** them back to the github clone!  

This is the file you will eventually turn in (a little meta...).  You can also view 
the instructions/assignment file on Github if you click on the .md file in the 
folder associated with the assignment you are working on.  

If this is your first time setting up repository  you may run into some 
authentication issues. See [instructions for the first assignment for help](https://github.com/jsgosnell/Starter_code/blob/master/1.%20_Getting_used_to_R/1.-Getting-Used-to-R.md).
