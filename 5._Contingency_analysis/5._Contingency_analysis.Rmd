Before doing this, review the **Contingency Analysis** lecture set slides from 
https://sites.google.com/view/biostats/lessons/contingency-analysis and
the  **5_beyond_binomial.R** script in the lecture_files folder of the
[CUNY-BioStats github repository](https://github.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats).

## Heart attacks 

1. Let’s look at some heart attack data.  Read in the data using
```{r}
heart_attacks <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/master/datasets/heartatk4R.txt",header=T, stringsAsFactors = T)
```
Every entry is a person that has suffered a heart attack. More information on the dataset can be found at

http://statland.org/Software_Help/DataDesk/datafile.htm 

We want to again test if heart attacks occur equally across genders.
* What if we know that males actually make up 50.8% of the population?

2. Still using the heart attack data, is survival independent of gender?

3. For people that have a heart attack before they turn 30, is survival independent of gender?

## Dolphins

4. Data on dolphin behavior was collected off the coast of Iceland. Data is @

http://www.statsci.org/data/general/dolpacti.txt

Since this is a .txt file, not a .csv, you’ll need to use something like

```{r}
dolphin <- read.table("http://www.statsci.org/data/general/dolpacti.txt", sep="", header = T, stringsAsFactors = T)
```

Is travelling independent of time of day?  You’ll need to consider
traveling vs not traveling due to different number of groups observed
in each period.  Carry out post-hoc tests if needed.

## Smoking

5. Use data on smoking and exercise from

http://www.r-tutor.com/elementary-statistics/goodness-fit/chi-squared-test-independence

to determine if smoking is independent of exercise. You’ll need to input data manually.  Carry out post-hoc tests if needed.
