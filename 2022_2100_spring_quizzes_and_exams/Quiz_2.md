# Medical applications of oxygen

A study was done to determine if oxygen was being appropriately supplied to patients
in a medical unit (Barrett et al 2020). They surveyed 636 patients in multiple wards and
found 66 were using oxygen.  Thirty of the patients receiving oxygen were female
and 36 were male.

* What is the observed rate of oxygen use for females in the sample?

* Address the research question:  Is oxygen use impacted by gender? Make sure your 
answer includes

  * null hypothesis
  * alternative hypothesis
  * explanation for test you will use
  * results from statistical test
  * clear explanation of how results relate to your stated hypotheses
  * confidence interval for your estimate
